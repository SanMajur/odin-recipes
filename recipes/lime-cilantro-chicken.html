    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This slow cooker cilantro-lime chicken is packed with vibrant, zesty
      flavors. The tender, juicy chicken pairs perfectly with fresh lime and
      aromatic cilantro, making it a refreshing twist on plain chicken. Serve it
      over rice, toss it into salads, or use it as a filling for tacos and wraps
      for a deliciously versatile meal.
